      <title>How to manage Big tasks with pomodoro technique</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Big&amp;rdquo; for pomodoro is anything that does not fit into the standard 25 minutes. In practice it appears that almost all tasks initially are &amp;ldquo;Big&amp;rdquo;. Typically you would &amp;ldquo;divide and conquer&amp;rdquo; such things but this only works when the scope of the task is known ahead. So how to tackle it when it&amp;rsquo;s not?
Make a plan to make a plan Usually what I do is I start a reasonably small pomodoro timer for just making a plan.</description>

      <description>Motivation is a great thing. It helps to move mountains, make lemonade from the apples or build the snowman out of rain. Also it helps to perform your daily job. But when it&amp;rsquo;s gone, even Chuck Norris cannot help you to bring it back. The problem is that it can be gone in the middle of the day leaving you with a pile of work that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do but you have to.</description>

      <description>What is the Pomodoro technique? Pomodoro is a time management technique for improving productivity. It was developed in Italy in 80s. It breaks down work into smaller tasks that can be done in 25-minute intervals, separated by short 5-minute breaks. During 25 minutes interval (called &amp;ldquo;pomodoro&amp;rdquo;) you should only work on the task you decided. In other words you should postpone checking social media and emails for when the break starts.</description>
