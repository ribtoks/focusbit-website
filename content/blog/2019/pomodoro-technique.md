Nothing screams lack of preparation louder than you uploading your stock images when the festivities have already started. You will sell lesser content because buyers normally prefer choosing the images they intend to use during the festivities early on. How then do you plan for the festivities when they are three to four months away and produce the best photos and videos? This article gives some pointers you should consider.

### How is early preparedness an advantage?

- **Buyers love to plan early enough.** By the end of October, a lot of buyers normally have a set of the artistic content they need to use during the upcoming Christmas season. This means that some had already started searching for the best stock images and videos as early as September even without the intention of buying. By the time October reaches, most buyers are already seeking to secure the art pieces they have selected during their research. It would be very hard to get a willing buyer when the month ends because a majority of them would have already made up their mind. While your art pieces might be of high quality, the time disadvantage means that buyers will rarely pay attention to them if you upload them too late.

- **Increased Visibility time**. It never hurts to have your works uploaded early enough even before buyers start streaming in. This is because you get more visibility when the buyers have more time and freedom to appreciate the meticulousness of your work. Surely, you do not want to create something in a hurry and let it be bought hurriedly only for your reputation to be ruined in the process.

- **Enhanced shooting comfort.** Even though hurry can bring out exceptional creativity in you, rarely will you be able to deliver great art pieces. Consider, for instance, the fact that you may want to look for some models who might have already travelled to enjoy the festivities if you wait too long. However, when you shoot early enough, you are only left with minor editing details meaning that the possibility of delivering quality pieces is higher. When you start early you have more time to react to any challenges that may come up and still deliver your best work greatly.
