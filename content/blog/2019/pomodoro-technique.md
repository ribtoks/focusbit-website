### What is the Pomodoro technique?

Pomodoro is a time management technique for improving productivity. It was developed in Italy in 80s. It breaks down work into smaller tasks that can be done in 25-minute intervals, separated by short 5-minute breaks. During 25 minutes interval (called "pomodoro") you should only work on the task you decided. In other words you should postpone checking social media and emails for when the break starts. You can [read more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) about it.

Despite being a very simple principle, it helped surprisingly many people to improve personal productivity. This system is very adaptable to different kinds of work. It doesn't matter what you're doing: writing, answering email or programming. The clock makes you accountable and focused on the task. Especially when you write down this task first.

### How can you use Pomodoro with FocusBit?

Despite being great approach overall, 25 minutes is kind of one-size-fits all solution. So in FocusBit you can set a custom time interval, however restrain from making it very long. Shorter intervals help you to stay on track so everything from 15 to 35 minutes should work just great.

After you decide on the inteval and write down your task in FocusBit, all is left to do is to start the timer. FocusBit will optionally notify you when one, two and three quarters of your interval will pass. Also FocusBit can show you progress on the taskbar or as a tray icon. When you will use this first time you will appreciate how ticking clock positively affects your work.

What about breaks? In Pomodoro they should be 5 minutes between tasks and 15 minutes each 4 "pomodoros". With FocusBit you can spend as much time between the tasks as needed. We believe that narrowing focus during work is more important than time-boxing rests.
