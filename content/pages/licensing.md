FocusBit for macOS, Windows and for Linux are separate applications.

On all platforms we support a <strong>free 2 week trial</strong> to allow you fully test FocusBit. The trial ends automatically and at the end you can decide if you want to purchase a license.

License is valid for all versions of the application so you can enjoy using FocusBit everywhere.

Prices for FocusBit may be different in your currency. In order to see how much it costs locally you have to start buying a license.

After the purchase allow some time for license generation. After it is ready, we will send it to your email.
