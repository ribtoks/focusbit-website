      <description>FocusBit is created by Taras Kushnir (that&amp;rsquo;s me ðŸ‘‹). I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer, architect and mentor.
I&amp;rsquo;m a big GTD believer and creating and using FocusBit personally helped me a lot. After I experienced magic of being able to concentrate I decided to share it with others.
If you have a support request please visit Support. Otherwise I will be happy to hear from your at hello@focusbit.com.</description>
